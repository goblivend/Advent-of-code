# Advent of code 2022

This year I will probably try to use Haskell or Lua\
(as well as Bash, Python, Java, JS, C#, C if needed)

## Feedback

### Day 1:
Was pretty easy to find a solution, did it first in shell, quite happy to have done it this fast.
Did it in Haskell afterward, quite shorter and seems nice when you understand how to use it, `$` is a nice feature

### Day 2:
Was sick so was quite tiring to do it, and clearly took more time than I should have but still managed to do it.
Perhaps not the nicest solution, will try to refactor it

### Day 3:
Was still a bit sick but was ok, managed to do the solution, though I didn't want to download any packages for now so had to copy paste the functions form their source

### Day 4:
Was quite easy, decided to download the package `split` anyway, just saving time quite happy about the solution, not to long.
Though I might try to refactor a bit..

### Day 5:
Was a bit tricky this one. I had a very good idea for an iterative language but didn't quite get one for Haskell at first so had to mess arround in order to find an idea
