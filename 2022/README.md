## Feedback

### Day 1:
Was pretty easy to find a solution, did it first in shell, quite happy to have done it this fast.
Did it in Haskell afterward, quite shorter and seems nice when you understand how to use it, `$` is a nice feature

### Day 2:
Was sick so was quite tiring to do it, and clearly took more time than I should have but still managed to do it.
Perhaps not the nicest solution, will try to refactor it
