# Advent-of-code

Advent of code, in several languages for fun

(But mainly in Haskell)

## Use

### A new day :

Execute the `build_day.sh` file to generate the necessary files depending on the chosen language

You need to execute it like

```sh
. build_day.sh [hs]
```

### Profiling :

Build the Haskell Docker Image:

```sh
docker build -t haskell-aoc .

```

Create a haskell Docker
```sh
docker run -it --rm --name haskell-aoc haskell-aoc
```
Keep it running in the background in order to launch your solutions on it

## 2021

Started coding in Shell, was too difficult, so finished in Python..

For More [details](./2021/README.md)

## 2022

Starting in shell and Haskell, will see how it goes

## 2023

For More [details](./2023/README.md)

## 2024

Continuing in haskell

Having fun trying to automate stuff as well

For More [details](./2024/README.md)

### 2025

Still in haskell, trying to explain my thoughts and clean the code as much as possible by using the language's design
