# Advent-of-code-2021
first Advent of code for me, probably be in several languages for fun
Trying them first in python to improve a bit an understand the problem, the if I've got time, trying to do them in bash to improve as well

## Feedback

### Day 1:
Was pretty easy to find a solution, not quite happy about the variables set with high values to avoid counting them but it works anyway...

The solution with bash allowed me to learn how to read a file in bash aand to understand comparisons between integers


### Day 2:
Python solution is quite long and I could simplify it as I did in Bash but... otherwise nothing special, wasn't too difficult to find the answer and I'm quite happy of the challenges for now

Here I (re) discovered switch in bash and found that using integer mixed with strings is quite messy (there is certainly a way to write a nicer code, but I don't know how for now). I also found a quite nice way to online error using boleans and understood a bit better lists in bash


### Day 3:
The challenge was straight forward to go, but the step were quite messy at first, managed to do something clean anyway, even though it is quite long

The Bash solution might be coming next week (week of the 06/12)


### Day 4:
The solution was straight forward, had some issues getting the board as int tho but it works now
    Perhaps I've been using list comprehension where I shouldn't (just to make short code) but now I understand how it works

The Bash solution might be coming next week (week of the 06/12)

### Day 4:
I found this one easier than day 4, except some difficulties to write all the diagonals, it was pretty simple, I quite happy I understood list comprehension yesterday, allowed me to use much less lines

The Bash solution might be coming next week (week of the 06/12)
