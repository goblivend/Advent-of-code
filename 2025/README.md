## Feedback

### Day 1:

Day one was nice.

A bit rusty, on haskell but ok enough, after solving it I thought of a way to use scanl instead of recursion

Quite happy of the simplification I managed to do, next step would be to try and create those the first time and not using a temporary version

### Day 2:

Today first solution was quite intuitive, then for the second one I tried different ideas to try and have a clean solution such as using Regex but didn't manage to find a clean solution.

So I did it by hand:

### Day 3:

Today was interesting.

I had to remember a few things about number and once I did I felt stupid not to have thought of it earlier.

### Day 4:

Today was quite nice and after part 1 I just adapted a little bit part 1 to actually remove the rolls and that was most of the work for this part.
