## Feedback

### Day 1:

As every year, still a bit rusty but managed to do it anyways

### Day 2:

Still rusty even found the part2 a bit difficult (might have been trying to do something opti since the beginning but that complexified a lot....)

### Day 3:

Today seemed complicated at first with the parsing but actually instead of using Read instances as I planned at the beginning, using Regex was easier.
The part 2 didn't suprise me too much, I just thought there would have been more operations instead of just `do` `don't` and `mul`...
