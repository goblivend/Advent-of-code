## Feedback

### Day 1:

Was a bit rusty for this restart in haskell, had difficulties downloading GHC, using packages and remembering the syntax
All in all it took me ~1h for something that should have taken 10mins...
Though this year's first is harder than previous years imo
And it didn't help that I tihnk that the subject is wrong ("eightwo" is considered as 82 while I think it should be only 8 since after it's "wo"and not "two"....)

### Day 2:

Summary of this dayy : it helps to read the subject
After 1h of parsing and getting the algo for the first part, and several minutes of trying to make it work realising that the subject asks for valid games and not invalid games.....
And as if I had not learned anything still didn't read the subject correctly and did stupid mistakes...
Still quite rusty on Haskell lots of going back and forward on the doc...
